# 🔐 Steganography Tool using Python

This project is a **Python-based Steganography application** that allows users to hide secret messages inside image files without visibly altering them. It ensures secure communication by combining image processing and data encoding.

## 🧠 What is Steganography?

**Steganography** is the practice of concealing a secret message within another, non-secret file or message. In this project, text data is embedded into images using techniques like **LSB (Least Significant Bit) encoding**, making it invisible to the human eye.
